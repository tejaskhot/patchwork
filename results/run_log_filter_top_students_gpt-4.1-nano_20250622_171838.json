Let's run the tests.  The current code has a bug: it only includes students with scores strictly greater than 90, but the requirement is to include students with scores of 90 or above.  Also, the code does not sort the names alphabetically, which is part of the requirement.  I will fix these issues in the code.  First, change the condition from `s[1] > 90` to `s[1] >= 90`.  Second, after collecting the names, sort them alphabetically before returning.  I will write the corrected code now.  I will also use a list comprehension as suggested by the requirements.  The list comprehension can be used to filter and collect the names in one line.  The sorted() function can be used to sort the list of names.  The corrected code should look like this:  ```python\\ndef filter_top_students(scores):\\n    return sorted([s[0] for s in scores if s[1] >= 90])\\n```  I will test this code.  Let's run the tests now.  I will prepare the code and tests for the run_tests tool.  The code is as above.  The tests are:  ```json\\n[\\n  {\\\"input\\\": [[\\\"Alice\\\", 95], [\\\"Bob\\\", 90], [\\\"Charlie\\\", 89]], \\\"expected\\\": [\\\"Alice\\\", \\\"Bob\\\"]},\\n  {\\\"input\\\": [[\\\"Zed\\\", 91], [\\\"Ann\\\", 92]], \\\"expected\\\": [\\\"Ann\\\", \\\"Zed\\\"]}\\n]\\n```  I will pass this to the run_tests tool.  Let's do that now.  I will write the code and tests in the proper format.  The entry point is 'filter_top_students'.  The code is the fixed version.  I will now execute the run_tests tool.  I will do this in the next step.  I will now call the run_tests tool with the fixed code and the test cases.
